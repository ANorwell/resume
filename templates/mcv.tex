\cventry{June 2017 - Present}{\textbf{Principal Software Engineer}}{Datto}{}{Boston, MA}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Initial developer and technical lead on reimplementation of SaaS backup system, using Scala, Elasticsearch, and ZFS.
    This system went live ahead of schedule with an improved featureset and has now replaced the original system, supporting millions of users and storing dozens of petabytes of data.
  \item Prototyped new product features that became incorporated into product, including a customer-facing backup details information view, reporting visualization view, and Azure-based Exchange data restore tool.
  \item Set up application monitoring framework and libraries to consistently collect app events and metrics, providing observability, dashboards, and KPIs for a large distributed system that handles hundreds of millions of events per day.
  \item Designed and helped implementg backup management and configuration system.
  \item Supported three scrum teams with architectural guidance, mentoring, and code reviews.
  \item Worked with Scrum product owners and engineering leadership to help plan product roadmap and set technical direction.
 \end{itemize} }

  \cventry{Nov 2013 - June 2017}{\textbf{Senior Software Engineer}}{Datto}{}{Boston, MA}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
