\section{\textbf{Experience}}

\cventry{Oct 2020 - Present}{\textbf{Senior Software Engineer}}{Amazon Web Services}{}{Boston, MA}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Designed and implemented the Elastic File System (EFS) cross-region replication feature, using Java, Python, and AWS CDK.
  \item Built simulation environment and property testing system to allow programmable, developer-driven, end-to-end randomized testing of EFS under the presence of faults and concurrent modifications.
  \item Analyzed and optimized performance of the EFS backup and restore system, resulting in a 4x throughput improvement.
  \item Supported and mentored a team of 8 engineers with code reviews, design reviews, learning sessions, and interviews.
  \item Operational and infrastructure development for a globally-deployed distributed system with millions of users.
 \end{itemize} }

\cventry{June 2017 - Oct 2020}{\textbf{Principal Software Engineer}}{Datto}{}{Boston, MA}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Initial developer and technical lead on reimplementation of SaaS backup system, using Scala, Elasticsearch, and ZFS.
    This system went live ahead of schedule with an improved featureset and has now replaced the original system, supporting millions of users and storing dozens of petabytes of data.
  \item Prototyped new product features that became incorporated into product, including a customer-facing backup details information view, reporting visualization view, and Azure-based Exchange data restore tool.
  \item Set up application monitoring framework and libraries to consistently collect app events and metrics, providing observability, dashboards, and KPIs for a large distributed system that handles hundreds of millions of events per day.
  \item Supported three scrum teams with architectural guidance, mentoring, and code reviews.
  \item Worked with Scrum product owners and engineering leadership to help plan product roadmap and set technical direction.
 \end{itemize} }

  \cventry{Nov 2013 - June 2017}{\textbf{Senior Software Engineer}}{Datto}{}{Boston, MA}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Designed and implemented stability, scalability, and feature improvements for a large distributed systems architecture, able to support backups for over a million users daily and built in Ruby on Rails using Redis, PostgresQL, Cassandra, and Amazon S3.
  \item Acted as project technical lead for a team of seven developers on a project to deliever a full Backup and Restore Solution for Office 365. Project was completed successfully and on-time. Presented the project to hundreds of partners at the DattoCon 2015 conference.
  \item Designed and was main contributor to open-source projects for an internally-used Apache Cassandra client and schema management tool.
  \item Designed and implemented an extendable API client and authentication framework that handled tens of millions of requests per day against many different APIs.
  \item Led a team involved in building a permissions management system as part of an effort to convert to a service-oriented architecture.
\end{itemize} }

  \cventry{Apr 2012 - Nov 2013}{\textbf{Software Developer / Team Lead}}{mDialog}{}{Toronto, ON}
