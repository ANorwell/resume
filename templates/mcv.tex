\section{\textbf{Projects/Open Source}}

\cventry{}{\textbf{Graph.js (2011)}}{http://anorwell.com/graph}{}{}{A Javascript Graph creation and visualization API using HTML 5 Canvas. Allows for flexible appearance and manipulation of graphs.  The example app created using this API allows users to draw, save (either using HTML5 LocalStorage or to the cloud),and share their graphs. }
  
\cventry{}{\textbf{Website (2010-11)}}{http://anorwell.com}{}{}{My personal website is a minimally-featured blog tool written from scratch. Implemented feature-equivalently in two versions: Ajax with a Python/MySQL backend, and PHP.  Supports upload, storage, and display of posts and music, as well as comments using Facebook's comment system. }
  
\cventry{}{\textbf{Resume Maker (2011)}}{https://github.com/ANorwell/resume}{}{}{A tool for creating multiple versions of a resume (or other document) by combining an Info XML file with template files that define the formatting to be applied to the info. For example, generate a latex and html version of the same resume. HTML/JS front-end to a perl backend. (This resume was automatically generated using this tool.)}
  
\cventry{}{\textbf{English/Transliterated Persian Translator (2011)}}{http://anorwell.com/engping}{}{}{A web (JS + HTML) tool for translating from English to Transliterated Persian, or vice versa, using various google language APIs.}
  
\cventry{}{\textbf{Graphics (2009)}}{https://github.com/ANorwell/graphics}{}{}{An implementation of some graphics algorithms and design patterns in C++ and using OpenGL/GLSL. Includes a surface subdivision algorithm that acting on an implementation of half-edge data structure, a scene manager, shader manager, quaternion camera, hit detection, and small shader library including a Phong shader. Compiles to a program with a game-like interface in which you can fly around graphics scenes.}
